Thanks for downloading Django MPTT

To install, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer, you can simply place the included ``mptt`` directory
somewhere on your PYTHONPATH, or symlink to it from somewhere on your
PYTHONPATH; this is useful if you're working from a Subversion checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later and a recent
Subversion checkout of Django's trunk. You can obtain Python from
http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
