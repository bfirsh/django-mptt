Installing an official release
==============================

Official releases are made available from
http://code.google.com/p/django-mptt/

Source distribution
-------------------

Download the .zip distribution file and unpack it. Inside is a script
named ``setup.py``. Enter this command::

   python setup.py install

...and the package will install automatically.

Windows installer
-----------------

A Windows installer is also made available - download the .exe
distribution file and launch it to install the application.

An uninstaller will also be created, accessible through Add/Remove
Programs in your Control Panel.


Installing the development version
==================================

Alternatively, if you'd like to update Django MPTT occasionally to pick
up the latest bug fixes and enhancements before they make it into an
offical release, perform a `Subversion`_ checkout instead. The following
command will check the application's development branch out to an
``mptt-trunk`` directory::

   svn checkout http://django-mptt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mptt-trunk

Add the resulting folder to your `PYTHONPATH`_ or symlink (`junction`_,
if you're on Windows) the ``mptt`` directory inside it into a directory
which is on your PYTHONPATH, such as your Python installation's
``site-packages`` directory.

You can verify that the application is available on your PYTHONPATH by
opening a Python interpreter and entering the following commands::

   >>> import mptt
   >>> mptt.VERSION
   (0, 3, 'pre')

When you want to update your copy of the Django MPTT source code, run the
command ``svn update`` from within the ``mptt-trunk`` directory.

.. caution::

   The development version may contain bugs which are not present in the
   release version and introduce backwards-incompatible changes.

   If you're tracking trunk, keep an eye on the `CHANGELOG`_ and the
   `backwards-incompatible changes wiki page`_ before you update your
   copy of the source code.

Using Django MPTT in your applications
======================================

Once you've installed Django MPTT and want to use it in your Django
applications, do the following:

   1. Put ``'mptt'`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
   2. Inherit the models you wish to use with MPTT from ``mptt.Model`` instead 
      of ``models.Model``. This step most be performed *before* you generate 
      tables with ``syncdb``. See the `models documentation`_ for more 
      information.

That's it!
